## Online tutorial

The course will utilize material from the [OMA](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/)
book, currently in its beta version. We encourage to familiarize with the content
of the book and try some examples already before the course starts.


## Lecture slides

Course slides will be shared at a later point.


## HintikkaXO dataset

In this course we will analyze
[HintikkaXOData](https://microbiome.github.io/microbiomeDataSets/reference/HintikkaXOData.html),
a study about the effects of fat diet and prebiotics on the microbiome of rat models [@ijerph18084049]. The dataset is briefly presented in [these slides](https://microbiome.github.io/course_2023_oulu/hintikkaxo_presentation.html).
