## Online tutorial

The course will utilize material from the [OMA](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/)
book, currently in its beta version. We encourage to familiarize with the content
of the book and try some examples already before the course starts.

If you would like to improve your skills in Quarto and Rmarkdown, you can refer to
[these resources](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/resources.html#quarto). In this
course we will analyze HintikkaXOData. You can find more information about this dataset
[here](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/containers.html#hintikka-desc).


## Lecture slides

Course slides will be shared at a later point.
