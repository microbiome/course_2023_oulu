# Program {#program}

The course takes place daily from 9am â€“ 5pm (CEST), including coffee,
lunch, and short breaks. Most of the time will be dedicated to
practical exercises, complemented by lectures and demos.

We expect that participants will prepare for the course in advance.
Instructions will be sent to the registered participants. Online
support will be available.

The material follows open online book created by the course teachers,
[Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA),
which supports R/Bioconductor framework for multi-omic data
integration and analysis.
