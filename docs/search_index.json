After the course you will know how to organize multiple data sources into a coherent framework, implement reproducible data science workflows, and approach common data analysis tasks by utilizing available documentation and R tools. The primary focus is on microbiome research but the covered data science methods are generally applicable and we will discuss links with other application domains such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, and single cell sequencing. Target audience: MSc students, PhD, postdoctoral, and other researchers who wish to learn new skills in statistical programming and data analysis. Academic students and researchers from Finland and abroad are welcome and encouraged to apply. Teaching material: We will follow open online documentation created by the course teachers, primarily the Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis (OMA) book. The training material walks you through the standard steps of omics data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis, visualization, and reproducible workflows. Preparatory material and video clips, and online support are available before the course. All teaching material will be shared openly. Figure source: Moreno-Indias et al.

Optionally: Read through the manuscripts in the reading tips (listed below). Try out reproducible reporting Quarto Read about the selected demo data: HintikkaXOData. You can also try to load it in R and explore the data structure. Online support: for installation and other issues, join us at Gitter. 4.2 Study material The course will use material from OMA online book, which is currently in its beta version. We encourage to familiarize with the content of the book and try some examples already before the course starts but this is optional. A more extensive checklist for getting started is available, and the slides and other teaching material will be shared at a later point through OMA. 4.2.1 Reading tips We suggest to read the following manuscripts in order to familiarize with some of the general concepts and approaches discussed at the course. Software for the Integration of Multiomics Experiments in Bioconductor. Ramos et al. Cancer Res. (2017). Orchestrating single-cell analysis with Bioconductor. Amezquita, R.A., Lun, A.T.L., Becht, E. et al. Nat Methods 17, 137–145 (2020). Bioconductor Workflow for Microbiome Data Analysis: from raw reads to community analyses. Callahan et al. (2016). F1000Res; 5: 1492. 4.3 Setting up R environment 4.3.1 Your own computer Setting up your own computer and using local R installation will allow you to continue using the same tools after the course. In order to do this, you can follow the OMA setup checklist. The course organizers can provide limited online support for installations via Gitter. However, installation is more demanding in some systems. We also provide the CSC notebook for the course (see below); this comes with all necessary R packages and data pre-installed for ease of use. 4.3.2 CSC Notebook We provide a temporary access to a cloud computing environment that readily contains the available software packages. Instructions to access the environment will be sent to the registered participants.
