After the course you will know how to organize multiple data sources into a coherent framework, implement reproducible data science workflows, and approach common data analysis tasks by utilizing available documentation and R tools. The primary focus is on microbiome research but the covered data science methods are generally applicable and we will discuss links with other application domains such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, and single cell sequencing. Target audience: MSc students, PhD, postdoctoral, and other researchers who wish to learn new skills in statistical programming and data analysis. Academic students and researchers from Finland and abroad are welcome and encouraged to apply. Teaching material: We will follow open online documentation created by the course teachers, primarily the Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis (OMA) book. The training material walks you through the standard steps of omics data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis, visualization, and reproducible workflows. Preparatory material and video clips, and online support are available before the course. All teaching material will be shared openly. Figure source: Moreno-Indias et al. (2021) Frontiers in Microbiology 12:11. 1.2 Schedule The course is organized in a live format. Preparatory material and video clips, and online support are available before the course. All teaching material will be shared openly. Venue: University of Oulu. June 19-21, 2023 (Mon-Wed). The course is organized in a live format. Costs: There is no registration fee for the course. Participants are expected to cover their own travel and accommodation. Accommodation: Housing tips can be found at https://visitoulu.fi/en/arrival-overnight/. Schedule: Contact teaching daily between 9am – 4pm, including lectures, demonstrations, hands-on sessions, and breaks. Day 1 Reproducible workflows with R/Bioconductor and Quarto Day 2 Tabular data analysis (working with single ’omics) Day 3 Multi-assay data integration (multi-omics methods) For a detailed schedule, see Section 2. The course can be extended by an independent assignment (details will be agreed with the main teacher). 1.3 How to apply Send a brief motivation letter to Anna Kaisanlahti anna.kaisanlahti@oulu.fi Applications from local students, and applications sent before May 15 will be given priority The course has maximum capacity of 20 participants. 1.4 Teachers and organizers Teachers: Leo Lahti is the main teacher and Associate Professor in Data Science at the University of Turku. Dr. Pande Erawijantari is a co-teacher. Course assistants are Tuomas Borman (Turku), Giulio Benedetti (Turku), and Anna Kaisanlahti (Oulu). Docent Justus Reunanen is the course coordinator. The course is organized by Health and Biosciences Doctoral Programme (HBS-DP) University of Oulu Graduate School, Research Unit of Translational Medicine, University of Oulu. The Finnish IT Center for Science (CSC) supports the course by providing cloud computing services. 1.5 Code of Conduct The Bioconductor community values an open approach to science that promotes the sharing of ideas, code, software and expertise collaboration diversity and inclusivity a kind and welcoming environment community contributions More details on its enforcement are available here. 1.6 Acknowledgments Citation: We thank all developers and contributors who have contributed open resources that supported the development of the training material.
