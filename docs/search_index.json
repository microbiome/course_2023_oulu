The participants get an overview of the reproducible data analysis workflow in modern multi-omics, with a focus on recent examples from published microbiome studies. After the course you will know how to approach new tasks in biomedical data analysis by utilizing available documentation and R tools. The teaching will follow open online documentation created by the course teachers, extending the online book Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis (https://microbiome.github.io/OMA). The openly licensed teaching material will be available online during and after the course, following national recommendations on open education. The training material walks you through the standard steps of biomedical data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis, visualization, reproducible reporting, and best practices in open science. We will teach generic data analytical skills that are applicable to common data analysis tasks encountered in modern omics research. The teaching format allows adaptations according to the student’s learning speed. 1.2 Schedule and organizers The course will be organized in a live format (Flyer) Venue University of Oulu. June 20-23, 2022. Schedule Contact teaching daily between 9am – 5pm, including lectures, demonstrations, hands-on sessions, and breaks. A detailed schedule is available at the course website: (https://microbiome.github.io/course_2022_oulu). Teachers and organizers Leo Lahti is the main teacher and Associate Professor in Data Science at the University of Turku, with specialization on biomedical data analysis. Course assistants are Tuomas Borman (University of Turku) is one of the main developers of the open training material covered by the course, Jenni Hekkala, a PhD researcher at the University of Oulu, in the group of the course coordinator Docent Justus Reunanen, and Rajesh Shigdel who has supported the writing of the course material. The course is jointly organized by Health and Biosciences Doctoral Programme University of Oulu Graduate School Cancer &amp; Translational Medicine Research Unit, University of Oulu Department of Computing, University of Turku, Finland Finnish IT Center for Science (CSC) supports the course with cloud computing services 1.3 How to apply Target audience The course is primarily designed for advanced MSc and PhD students, Postdocs, and biomedical researchers who wish to learn and develop new skills in scientific programming and biomedical data analysis. Academic students and researchers from Finland and abroad are welcome and encouraged to apply. The course has limited capacity of max 20 participants, and priority will given for local students from Oulu.

You can make a report either anonymously or personally. All reports will be reviewed by the Code of Conduct Committee and will be kept confidential. Electronically You can make an anonymous or non-anonymous report via the following link: https://forms.gle/gEWHBWnXvZbEdFsq5. It is a free-form text box that will be forwarded to the Code of Conduct Committee. Alternatively you can email the Code of Conduct Committee (code-of-conduct@bioconductor.org). If you are uncomfortable reporting to the Code of Conduct committee as a group, you can contact any individual committee member via email or a direct message on the community-bioc Slack channel. Please include screenshots/copies of all relevant electronic conversations whenever possible (you don’t need to compromise your anonymity!). We can’t follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence. Personal Report (for any Bioconductor events: in-person or virtual) You can make a personal report to any member of the event Code of Conduct committee present at an event. When taking a personal report, we will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. We may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we’ll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won’t be asked to confront anyone, and we won’t tell anyone who you are. Our team will be happy to help you get the relevant support (e.g. help contacting hotel/venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event). We value your attendance and participation at Bioconductor events and in our community.
