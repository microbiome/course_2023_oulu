After the course you will know how to organize multiple data sources into a coherent framework, implement reproducible data science workflows, and approach common data analysis tasks by utilizing available documentation and R tools. The primary focus is on microbiome research but the covered data science methods are generally applicable and we will discuss links with other application domains such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, and single cell sequencing. Target audience MSc students, PhD, postdoctoral, and other researchers who wish to learn new skills in statistical programming and data analysis. Academic students and researchers from Finland and abroad are welcome and encouraged to apply. Teaching material We will follow open online documentation created by the course teachers, Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis https://microbiome.github.io/OMA. The training material walks you through the standard steps of omics data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis, visualization, and reproducible workflows. Preparatory material and video clips, and online support are available before the course. All teaching material will be shared openly. Figure source: Moreno-Indias et al.

Install and load the required R packages (see Section 3.3) After a successful installation you can start with the case study examples in this training material 3.2 Support and resources We recommend to have a look at the additional reading tips and try out online material listed in Section 5. You can run the workflows by simply copy-pasting the examples. For further, advanced material, you can test and modify further examples from the online book, and apply these techniques to your own data. Online support on installation and other matters, join us at Gitter 3.3 Installing and loading the required R packages Note that the CSC/RStudio environment has readily installed setup. You may need the examples from this subsection if you are installing the environment on your own computer. If you need to add new packages, you can modify the examples below.

Perform the following tasks: If you are entirely new to Quarto, take this short tutorial to get introduced to the most important functions within Quarto Then experiment with different options with Quarto. Create a Quarto template in RStudio, and render it into a document (markdown, PDF, docx or other format). In case you are new to Quarto, its documentation provides resources to learn about the use cases and the basics of Rmarkdown.
