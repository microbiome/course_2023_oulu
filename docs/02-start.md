## Local environment setup

The CSC notebook environment is developed for the present course, so it comes
with all necessary R packages and data pre-installed for ease of use. However,
in case you prefer to work on your local RStudio, you can follow this
[setup checklist](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/training.html#training)
provided in the OMA book, along with all its additional links and tips.
