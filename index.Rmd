## Contents and learning goals

This course will focus on **multi-omic data integration and analysis with R/Bioconductor**, a popular open source environment for scientific data analysis. As a participant, you will get an overview of reproducible data science workflows based on examples from recently published microbiome studies. After the course you will know how to approach common data analysis tasks in taxonomic and functional profiling studies by utilizing available documentation and R tools.

The teaching follows open online documentation created by the course teachers, extending the online book Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis [https://microbiome.github.io/OMA](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA). The training material walks you through the standard steps of omics data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis, visualization, and best practices in open science.

## Schedule and organizers

The course is organized in a live format. Preparatory material and video clips, and online support are available before the course. All teaching material will be shared openly.

**Venue** University of Oulu. June 20-22, 2023 (Tue-Thu).

**Schedule** Contact teaching daily between 9:30am -- 16:30pm, including lectures, demonstrations, hands-on sessions, and breaks. A detailed schedule is being updated at the course website: [https://microbiome.github.io/course_2023_oulu](https://microbiome.github.io/course_2023_oulu)

**Teachers** [Leo Lahti](https://datascience.utu.fi) is the main teacher and Associate Professor in Data Science at the University of Turku, with two decades of experience in statistical data analysis and R/Bioconductor development. Course assistants are PhD researchers *Tuomas Borman* (University of Turku), one of the main developers of the open training material covered by the course, and *Jenni Hekkala* (University of Oulu), from the group of the course coordinator Docent *Justus Reunanen*.

The course is jointly organized by Health and Biosciences Doctoral Programme (HBS-DP) University of Oulu Graduate School, Cancer & Translational Medicine Research Unit, University of Oulu, and the Department of Computing, University of Turku, Finland. The Finnish IT Center for Science (CSC) supports the course with cloud computing services.

## How to apply

**Target audience**

The course is designed for advanced MSc and PhD students, Postdocs, and researchers who wish to learn new skills in scientific programming and data analysis, with an emphasis on microbiome research and multi-omics. Academic students and researchers from Finland and abroad are welcome and encouraged to apply. The course has limited capacity of max 20 participants, and priority will be given for local students from Oulu.

**Application**

-   Send a brief motivation letter to Jenni Hekkala [jenni.hekkala\@oulu.fi](mailto:jenni.hekkala@oulu.fi){.email}
-   Applications sent before May 15 will be given priority

**Course fee**

The course does not have a registation fee. Participants are expected to cover their own travel and accommodation.
