## Contents and learning goals

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-8}
**Contents and learning goals** This course will teach the basics on multi-omic data integration and analysis with R/Bioconductor, a popular open source environment for scientific data analysis. We will focus on examples from recently published microbiome studies. After the course you will know how to approach common data analysis tasks by utilizing available documentation and R tools.

**Target audience** MSc students, PhD, postdoctoral, and other researchers who wish to learn generic skills in scientific programming and data analysis. While priority will be given for local students from Oulu, academic students and researchers from Finland and abroad are welcome and encouraged to apply.

**Teaching material** We will follow open online documentation created by the course teachers, Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis [https://microbiome.github.io/OMA](https://microbiome.github.io/OMA). The training material walks you through the standard steps of omics data analysis covering data access, exploration, analysis, visualization, and reproducible workflows. Preparatory material and video clips, and online support are available before the course. All teaching material will be shared openly.


## Schedule and organizers

The course is organized in a live format. Preparatory material and video clips, and online support are available before the course. All teaching material will be shared openly.

**Venue** University of Oulu. June 20-22, 2023 (Tue-Thu). The course is organized in a live format. 

**Costs** no registation fee; participants are expected to cover their own travel and accommodation (see the course homepage).

**Schedule** Contact teaching daily between 9am -- 16pm, including lectures, demonstrations, hands-on sessions, and breaks. 

 * Day 1 R/Bioconductor framework and reproducible workflows 
 * Day 2 Tabular data analysis and examples from microbiome research
 * Day 3 Multi-assay data integration approaches



**Teachers** [Leo Lahti](https://datascience.utu.fi) is the main teacher and Associate Professor in Data Science at the University of Turku. Course assistants are PhD researchers *Tuomas Borman* (Turku), and *Jenni Hekkala* (Oulu) from the group of the course coordinator Docent *Justus Reunanen*. The course is jointly organized by [Health and Biosciences Doctoral Programme (HBS-DP)](https://www.oulu.fi/en/research/graduate-school/organisation-and-contact-information-uniogs/health-and-biosciences-doctoral-programme) University of Oulu Graduate School, Cancer & Translational Medicine Research Unit, University of Oulu, and the Department of Computing, University of Turku, Finland. The [Finnish IT Center for Science (CSC)](https://csc.fi/) supports the course by providing cloud computing services.
